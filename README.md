# React Boilerplate
Boilerplate for react apps. Does not use Create React App. Uses `node` for runtime, `webpack` for bundling and `babel` for compiling. This is barebones, so if you need other tools like [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) then feel free to install after cloning this project locally.

## Getting Started
1. Use whatever CLI of your chosing (iTerm, built-in VS Code terminal, etc)
2. Run `git clone git@github.com:leetoufong/react-boilerplate.git`
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run start` to spin up a local dev server
5. Run `npm run build` to build the project into `/dist` directory
